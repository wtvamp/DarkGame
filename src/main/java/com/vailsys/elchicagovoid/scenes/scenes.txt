@heroName wakes up in a body bag and notices that he is in a dark forest, 
all he knows is that he must escape, even if it cost’s his life.
The air is full of fog and all he sees is nothing but dead animals 
and human body parts scattered across the branches of the trees.
@heroName is going to have to figure out a way of this death maze.
